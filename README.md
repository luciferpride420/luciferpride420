- 👋 Hi, I’m Yassine 
- 👀 I’m started to learn coding a few years as of now  
- 🌱 The first language i learned was C, before i went and learned front-end languages (HTML, CSS and JS).
- 🥸 I’m currently learning PHP as a mean to develop my fullstack profile.
- 🧐 I also had some time to experiment with Arduino and Mathlab as they were a big help for some projects.
- 💞️ I’m not very familiar yet with Github, as it was only a way to download needed libraries or so... but i'm getting there folks (y) ! 
- 📫 You can reach me via my Github profile as i'm using it more by the day, but you can always contact me @ yassinechraibi20@gmail.com.
- ⚡ Fun fact: Water might not be wet. 🤔
                This is because most scientists define wetness as a liquid’s ability to maintain contact with a solid surface. 😯
                Which means that water itself isn't wet, but can make other objects wet. 😵‍💫
